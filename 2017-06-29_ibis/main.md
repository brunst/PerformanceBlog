## Workflow analysis with Score-P and Vampir

### Motivation

Today, I am writing about analyzing a simulation workflow that is a bit tricky.
It combines a parallel executable (the workflow master) and a serial solver that is called from this master multiple times.    

### The parallized IBIS workflow simulates ground water movements  
Application to be studied

### Workflow stresses I/O system service 
Region of interest

### How to tell Score-P to conduct multiple experiments at the same time
Experiment protocol

### Key performance indicators
Scalability and efficiency

### Load balance

### Summary
...of observations.
