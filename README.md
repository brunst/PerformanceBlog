## Welcome to this software performance analysis blog

Today, software performance strongly depends on the approriate usage of system hardware and software. 
Unfortunately, efficient software is not generated automatically by compilers in most cases.
Usually, software needs to be tuned for optimal usage of vector registers, cache memory, multiple cores, GPU accelerators, and network interconnects.  
Without manual optimization, the total computational performance tends to be lower than 1% of the theoretical peak performance.    

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/brunst/PerformanceBlog/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/brunst/PerformanceBlog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
